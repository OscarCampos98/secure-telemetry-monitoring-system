# secure-telemetry-monitoring-system

## Introduction

The **Secure Telemetry Monitoring System** is designed to provide **secure data transmission and monitoring** for uncrewed vehicles. It ensures the integrity and confidentiality of telemetry data while allowing real-time command execution and validation.

This system implements **AES-256 encryption** and **HMAC-SHA-256 authentication** to protect sensitive telemetry data and commands from tampering or interception. It also includes **LED indicators** to provide real-time feedback on the systemâ€™s status, helping operators quickly assess security and operational conditions.

The project is structured to be modular, making it **scalable and adaptable** to different uncrewed vehicle platforms.
